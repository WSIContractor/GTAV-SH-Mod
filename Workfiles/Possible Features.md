# Possible Features<br><br>
## First Person View in interior.<br>
- Switching to First Person View when going inside interior. When going outside returning back to last known camera position from player.<br>
-- Possible issue is running of player while in FPV. This could be solved by enabling Crouch or Stealth mode.<br><br>

## Custom House Makeover.<br>
- When buying a custom house you get a standard interior. But you can select to change that interior. Depending on the type of interior you get waiting time before it is finished.<br>
-- When you buy a Low house you get normal prices for low interiors, higher prices for mediums, and a lot higher prices for highend interiors.<br>
-- When you buy a Medium house you get low prices for low interiors, normal prices for mediums, and higher prices for highend interiors.<br>
-- When you buy a Highend house you get very cheap prices for low interiors, cheap prices for mediums, and normal prices for highend interiors.<br><br>

## Working RV Safepoint and Interiors<br>
- Making both moving RV work as a safepoint with interior.<br>
-- We need to get the interior from a trailer.<br><br>

## Selling of houses<br>
Houses are assigned a price for buying. Currently when it is sold you gain the same amount of money. No risk, No reward. So maybe this can be changed.<br><br>
1. Adding costs for the realtor.<br>
2. You select which realtor can sell it with all different prices but also different percentages in getting a big payout.<br><br>
This way when you take the cheap realtor and are lucky you get a real big payout but when you are unlucky you make a huge loss.<br><br>

## Navigating to hotels<br>
It would be very nice to make all hotel blips disappear. Then by the press of a button(internet maybe) you get a menu where you select the class of the hotel and then it creates a waypoint to the nearest hotel.

## For sale signs.<br>
A nice feature would be to have for sale signs by the houses/apartments that disappear when the property is bought. 

## Working objects inside interiors<br>
A lot of people have been asking for working tv's, wardrobe's and other objects that you could normally interact with. So it would be nice to add this to the mod.

## Working garages.<br>
It would be really great if we could turn some of the ingame garages into real working garages. We need to be able to remove the garagedoor. When Map Editor allows this we can add our own door and make it dynamic leaves us with only the interior walls to build.

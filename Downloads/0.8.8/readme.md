#This version is stable!

There is however a slight issue with the LUA Plugin. Which is demanding a different syntax on every computer. 
In some cases it wants to have the value returned in the form of a `1/0` and on other computers it want to receive a `true/false` value.<br><br>

Because of this we decided to upload both!<br><br>

Version 1 = True/False<br>
Version 2 = 1/0<br><br>

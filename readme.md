## Features
- 69 houses, 43 hotels and apartments for rent.
- Each house, apartment or hotel suite has interior (currently 15 interiors in total)
// Please note that R* did not make many interiors for GTA V. We are adding custom-built interiors in each version, but those take some time to build and can lower your FPS count when nearby.
- Custom savehouse or save spot can be created anywhere on the map.
- Characters own their houses so they won't live together.
- Multiple characters can live in the same hotel.
- Realistic pricing depending on exteriors and locations.
